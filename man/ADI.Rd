\title{Function ADI}
\usage{
ADI(data_sheet, bytes, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{data_sheet}{\bold{either} a data.frame f.e imported from a data sheet containing\cr
"Name","item.number"\cr
"action.from.","action.to","kind.of.action"\cr
"name.of.action","action.number","classification","weighting"\cr
\cr
\bold{or} only "action.from.","action.to","kind.of.action"if exists actions and items\cr
\cr
actions: with  "name.of.action","action.number","classification","weighting\cr 
Weigting the factor which should be used to calculate the behavior (1 for "action.from"" wins -1 for "action.to" wins")\cr
Setting a behaviour to 2 means it is count double\cr
items:  with "Name","item.number"\cr}

\item{bytes}{a string where each enabled action is set to 1 and each disabled action is set to 0\cr
Setting a behaviour to 2 means it is count double\cr}

\item{\dots}{Additional parameters:
 \describe{
  \item{\bold{actions}}{(data.frame) with "name.of.action","action.number","classification","weighting"; Classification 1 if "action.from"" wins; Classification 2 if "action.to" wins}
  \item{\bold{Weigting}}{the factor which should be used to calculate the behavior (1 for "action.from"" wins -1 for "action.to" wins")\cr
Setting a behaviour to 2 means it is count double}
  \item{\bold{vcolors}}{as much colors as items, colors will returned as sorted ADI colors means color 1 = item rank 1, color 2 = item rank 2, and so on}
  \item{\bold{workbook}}{the XlConnect Workbook for the Excel file to be changed\cr
note: The workbook must be opened before}
  \item{\bold{sheet}}{the sheet name ( ADI will be added to be sure not to delete any data}
  \item{\bold{savecounts}}{if TRUE: save the counts of actions as sheet (availalbe only with workbook}
  \item{\bold{saveAdi}}{if TRUE: save the FDI as sheet (availalbe only with workbook}
 }}
}
\value{
returns a list with\cr
ADI - the Average Dominance index\cr
Colors - the colors supported by vcolors sorted by ADI of the items\cr
ADI_count_matrix - the counts from which the ADI was calulated\cr
}
\description{
A package to calculate Dominance Indices, print Soical Network Graphs and Music Notation Graphs.
